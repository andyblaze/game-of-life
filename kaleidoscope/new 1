Visual Layers

Backdrop / “Pebble Bed”

A single static image (could be a photo or a painted texture).

Slight blur or color shift so it feels submerged.

Maybe slowly darken or lighten over time, as if light ripples are passing over it.

The Core Idea: “Voronoi Caustics”

Instead of static polygons, treat the Voronoi map as a moving, refracted light pattern:

Think of it like the bright interference lines made when sunlight bends through shallow water.

Each cell acts as a pocket of brighter or dimmer light.

Gentle motion of cell points + soft blur = living shimmer.

🧩 Implementation Layers

You’d overlay this Voronoi “light map” on top of the pebble image but underneath the particle layers.

1️⃣ Generate Voronoi pattern

Place ~100–300 seed points across the canvas.

Compute distance from each pixel to its nearest seed → gives you cell boundaries.

Use a smooth falloff, not sharp edges — think gradient borders, not polygons.

2️⃣ Animate it

Move the seed points slightly over time, using curl noise or slow sine waves.

This causes the cells to drift and morph continuously.

You can even vary their motion speed subtly so the pattern never repeats.

3️⃣ Light simulation

Convert the Voronoi distance map to a light mask:

Bright along cell edges (simulating refracted caustic lines).

Dimmer toward cell centers.

You can invert or threshold it to emphasize the bright ridges.

Multiply or screen-blend this over the pebble background.

4️⃣ Optional: Depth shimmer

Slightly modulate the brightness of each Voronoi cell using low-frequency Perlin noise.

It mimics light passing through different water depths — soft pulsation rather than flicker.

🪩 Visual Tips

Keep Voronoi cells large enough (20–50px typical).

Use high contrast but low alpha — subtlety is key; it should “breathe,” not flash.

Apply a small Gaussian blur after drawing to soften hard edges.

Blue-tinted highlights work beautifully if your pebbles are neutral.

Fast “Fake Caustics” Voronoi (stylized + efficient)

Concept: Skip full Voronoi math — fake the look by layering animated soft circles (the seed points) and using their overlapping brightness as a pseudo-Voronoi field.
How:

Draw blurred white circles at each seed position.

Composite with screen or additive blending.

Animate circle positions slightly with noise.

You’ll get organic intersecting highlight lines that look just like refracted light.

Option: modulate brightness with a low-frequency sine wave or noise to fake “caustics.”

The “Depth Stack” Concept

Think of your canvas as 3–5 transparent “sheets,” each holding its own population of particles.
Each sheet represents a depth plane in a shallow, drifting world.
They all use the same basic particle logic (curl noise advection), but with different visual and behavioral parameters.

🧩 1️⃣ Layer Parameters

For each depth layer (say, back, mid, front), vary these properties:

Property	Far Layer	Mid Layer	Near Layer	Effect
Particle count	High	Medium	Low	Far feels more filled, near feels sparse
Particle size	Large & soft	Medium	Small & sharp	Near particles look crisp
Alpha / opacity	Low	Medium	High	Fades with “distance”
Color saturation	Desaturated blues	Natural tones	Slightly warm/bright	Creates aerial perspective
Noise scale (curl freq)	Large-scale noise	Medium	High-frequency turbulence	Adds parallax-like movement
Velocity / damping	Slower	Medium	Faster	Near particles drift quicker
Trail length	Long	Medium	Short	Distant ones smear, near ones pop

🎬 2️⃣ Parallax Motion

You can fake parallax by scaling each layer’s flow field slightly differently:

Deeper layers move slower and respond less to input.

Foreground layers respond more quickly (or even slightly differently to the same noise pattern).

The key: even if all layers share the same noise source, offset their coordinates:

💨 3️⃣ Atmospheric Blend

Subtle tweaks that tie it together visually:

Slight overall blur on the background layer (soft focus).

Foreground has a tiny bit of brightness contrast boost.

A faint tint overlay (like a gentle gradient from blue at bottom to gold at top) mimics light falloff through fluid.

🔮 4️⃣ Depth Cues From Interactions

Later, you can add occasional “cross-layer” interactions:

Particles on front layers briefly occlude or cast shadows on back layers (faked by alpha blending order).

Or have deeper particles fade momentarily when a near one passes above it (as if light scattered).
Even without physics, these tiny cues can give physical believability.

5️⃣ Optional: Layer Distortion

To push the illusion further:

Slightly distort deeper layers with low-amplitude noise or sine waves.
→ Mimics refraction through water.

Let near layers stay more stable → adds realism through relative motion.

Optional Top Layer – Light Refraction Film

A faint, moving distortion or soft “glass ripple” overlay.

Could be noise-mapped displacement, or just low-opacity sine waves that subtly warp what’s beneath.
