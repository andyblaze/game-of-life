Dreamflow – Revival Notes

Concept:
A soft, flowing cellular automaton–meets–liquid simulation in pure JavaScript.
Uses two grids (double buffering) to diffuse energy/colour fields and create smooth, organic motion.
Upscaled to full canvas for beautiful, painterly visuals.

🧠 Core Questions to Ask ChatGPT:

Paste one (or all) of these tomorrow to pick up exactly where you left off 👇

1️⃣ Getting Started

“Let’s start Dreamflow — a smooth fluid-like cellular automata in JS. I want two buffers (A and B), each width×height arrays, and we’ll diffuse values by averaging 9 neighbors. Show me the skeleton simulation loop and render pass.”

2️⃣ Diffusion Rule

“Now let’s add a diffusion rule — each cell’s new value = average of itself + 8 neighbors, plus a small damping factor (so it slowly fades).”

3️⃣ Color Field

“Let’s evolve a 3-channel field (R, G, B), so it looks like a moving liquid or heat map. We’ll convert each cell’s value to color and render via ImageData.”

4️⃣ Excitation / Input

“Add random excitation: occasionally inject energy into random spots so ripples and flows keep appearing.”

5️⃣ Visual Style

“I want it to look like flowing ink — deep colors, smoothed edges. Add a post-process step or color mapping to give it that ‘Dreamflow’ aesthetic.”

6️⃣ Performance

“Optimize the loop for a 480×270 grid using typed arrays and ImageData updates. Keep it 60fps.”

7️⃣ Interactivity (optional)

“Let’s make Dreamflow interactive: clicking or moving the mouse injects energy or color into the field.”

8️⃣ Artistic Enhancements (later)

“How can we blend this with noise fields, velocity maps, or particle feedback to make the flow more organic?”

🧩 Extra Notes

Grid size: 480×270 (half-1080p) upscaled to full canvas.

Data type: Float32Array or Uint8Array.

Always swap buffers ([a, b] = [b, a]).

Render via ctx.putImageData() once per frame.

Optionally add per-cell phase oscillations for “living liquid” feel.
