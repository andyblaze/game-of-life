üéØ Goal

Simulate the iconic "digital rain" effect from The Matrix ‚Äî cascading streams of green symbols falling vertically across the screen, each at its own pace, with a glowing or fading trail.

Great Monospaced Fonts with CJK (Kanji etc) Support:
1. M PLUS 1 Code  https://fonts.google.com/specimen/M+PLUS+1+Code

    ‚úÖ Monospaced

    ‚úÖ Japanese support (Kanji, Kana)

    ‚úÖ Free and on Google Fonts

    üéØ Ideal for code, terminal-style, and Matrix effects.

2. Noto Sans Mono CJK https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans+Mono

    ‚úÖ Noto is Google's all-language font project.

    ‚úÖ "Noto Sans Mono CJK" supports Chinese, Japanese, and Korean.

    ‚úÖ Designed to be monospace

    ‚úÖ Free to use

    üîç Might need to self-host or download manually for full support (Google Fonts doesn‚Äôt include the Mono CJK subset yet).

3. Cica https://github.com/miiton/Cica

    ‚úÖ Japanese-focused monospace font

    ‚úÖ Popular among Japanese developers

    üß© May require downloading and bundling locally.

4. IBM Plex Mono + Plex Sans JP https://github.com/IBM/plex

    You can mix:

        IBM Plex Mono for ASCII

        IBM Plex Sans JP for Kanji/Kana

    Both are stylistically close enough to work together if you fall back selectively.

üß† Core Concepts
1. Grid / Columns

    The screen is divided into vertical columns (like a grid of characters).

    Each column can have one or more active drops falling down it.

    Columns should be equally spaced ‚Äî determined by character width or some fixed spacing.

2. Drops

Each drop is a stream of characters falling vertically. It consists of:

    A head: the current character being rendered at the front.

    A trail: a few previous characters fading in brightness or opacity.

Properties per drop might include:

    X-position (column)

    Current Y-position (row)

    Length of trail

    Speed

    Characters in the stream (can be randomly picked or generated on the fly)

3. Character Rendering

    Each character is a symbol, usually from a selected set (e.g., katakana, Latin, or binary).

    Characters change as they fall (either every frame, every few frames, or randomly).

Colors:

    Head: bright green or white.

    Trail: gradient of green, fading to black.

4. Timing & Movement

    Each drop should move at its own pace ‚Äî to avoid uniformity.

    You may update positions per frame or with a staggered/random delay.

    When a drop reaches the bottom, it:

        Can restart from the top.

        Or "rest" for a while before restarting.

5. Canvas / Rendering

    A Canvas fits the entire screen.

    Rendering involves:

        Clearing the canvas (or using alpha transparency for trailing effect).

        Drawing each drop's head and trail characters.

        Applying fading via opacity or color interpolation.

6. Data Model Design

Think about:

    An array of columns, each holding one or more drops.

    Each drop is an object with its position, speed, trail, and symbols.

‚úÖ Optional Enhancements

    Random symbol switching on the fly.

    Occasional symbol "explosions" or bursts.

    Keyboard/mouse interaction to spawn extra drops.

    Glowing or blur effects via shadow blur or post-processing.

Summary: What Needs to Happen

    Setup: Divide screen into vertical columns.

    Spawn drops: One or more per column, with unique speed/trail.

    Render loop:

        Clear/fade screen slightly.

        Update positions of drops.

        Draw head/trail symbols with fading effect.

    Cycle: Drop reaches bottom ‚Üí reset it or remove it.
