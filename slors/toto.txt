Short answer: you’re in exactly the right ballpark.
Longer answer: old one-armed bandits usually had far fewer distinct symbols than people think, but many more total symbol positions.

Let’s untangle that, because it matters a lot for your design.

Distinct symbols (the icons you draw)

Classic machines typically had 6–10 distinct symbols:

Very common set:

Cherry

Lemon

Orange

Plum

Bell

BAR

Seven (later / higher-end machines)

Some had:

Horseshoes

Stars

Watermelons

So 16 distinct icons is actually generous, not restrictive.

You won’t need that many — but having them gives you tuning freedom.

Total symbols per reel (this is the important bit)

Each reel had a physical strip, often:

20–30 stops per reel

sometimes more on later machines

Example (very realistic):

Reel 1: 20 symbols

Reel 2: 22 symbols

Reel 3: 24 symbols

But those symbols repeat.

So a reel might look like:

8 cherries

5 lemons

4 plums

2 bells

1 seven

That distribution is the odds.

Why jackpots felt impossible

The famous trick was:

Jackpot symbol appears once on reel 3

Maybe twice on reel 1

Maybe three times on reel 2

So:

You constantly see two sevens

The third is rare by construction

No software trickery needed.

How this maps to your 16 icons

You have two excellent options:

Option A (most authentic)

Use ~8–10 icons

Repeat them heavily across reels

Keep strips around 20–25 long

This will feel old-school immediately.

Option B (educational, flexible)

Use all 16 icons

Some appear once

Some appear many times

Many will never realistically win

This is actually great for experimentation.

A concrete, period-accurate starting point

If you want something that feels right:

3 reels

24 stops per reel

8 symbols total

Example per reel:

8 × Cherry

6 × Lemon

4 × Plum

3 × Orange

2 × Bell

1 × BAR

(And only one reel has a Seven.)

That alone will teach you everything.

One key insight you’ll discover

You’ll realise very quickly:

Changing one symbol on one reel
does more than changing any payout value.

That’s the old-school magic.

TL;DR

Old machines: ~6–10 distinct symbols

Reel strips: ~20–30 total positions

Repetition, not variety, controlled odds

Your 16 icons are more than enough

Scarcity is the real lever

If you want, next we can:

design a historically plausible reel strip

calculate jackpot odds from it

or decide which icons should be “lies” (present but never realistically winning)

You’re building this very authentically already.
